The Python scripts for generating the figures (electric and magnetic dipole scattering in graphene) are now available in the following public GitHub repository:

🔗 https://github.com/yohannesachenefe/graphene-dipole-scattering

The repository contains:

plot_fig1.py – Polar plot of electric and magnetic dipole angular distributions.

plot_fig2.py – 2D heatmap of differential cross section versus angle and dipole strength.

plot_fig3.py – Enhanced and simplified versions of transport cross-section vs dipole moment, including analytical calculations and subplots.

Feel free to clone, use, or contribute to the code.
